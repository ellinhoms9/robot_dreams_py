        </div>
        <p>I have been interested in programming since school.
            After graduating from university, I have started learning
            Python. later I became interested in system administration,
            and began to study and develop in this field. In which I later
            got a job, and worked for more than 3 years in the office as
            a system administrator.
            But now I want to return to my dream, and become a Python developer.
